## Deployment to Netlify

1. Create a Netlify account if you don't have one: [Netlify Sign-Up](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

2. Install the Netlify CLI (Command Line Interface) globally:
```
npm install -g netlify-cli

```
3. Log in to your Netlify account:
```
netlify login

```
4. Build your React app for production:

```
npm run build

```

5. Deploy your app to Netlify:

```
netlify deploy
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal to set up the deployment, including selecting a site name, build command, and publishing directory. The build command should be npm run build, and the publish directory should be built.

6. Once the deployment is complete, your app will be accessible through a Netlify URL (e.g., https://your-site-name.netlify.app). You can configure custom domains and other settings in the Netlify dashboard.

## Customization
You can customize the clone by editing the React components and styles in the src directory. Make sure to test your changes locally using npm start before deploying to Netlify.
